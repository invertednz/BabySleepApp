# Weekly Advice Generation - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Telemetry & Audit Logging ✅
**File**: `supabase/migrations/0016_add_advice_generation_audit.sql`

Created `advice_generation_audit` table to track:
- Every generation attempt (success, error, skipped)
- Trigger source (scheduled, manual, upgrade, api)
- Execution time in milliseconds
- Error messages and stack traces
- Model version used
- Metadata (JSON) for additional context

**Features**:
- RLS enabled - users can view their own logs
- Service role can insert (for batch jobs)
- Indexed by baby_id, user_id, status, trigger_source
- Comprehensive error tracking with preview of failed responses

### 2. Scheduled Batch Generation ✅
**File**: `supabase/functions/generate_weekly_advice_batch/index.ts`

Service-role Edge Function that:
- Queries all babies with paid plans (`plan_tier IN ('paid', 'premium')` AND `is_on_trial = false`)
- Calls `generate_weekly_advice` for each baby
- Logs all outcomes to audit table
- Returns summary: total, success, error, skipped counts
- Respects weekly caching (skips if plan still valid)

**Usage**:
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/generate_weekly_advice_batch \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -d '{"trigger_source": "scheduled"}'
```

### 3. Auto-Generation on Upgrade ✅
**File**: `supabase/migrations/0017_add_advice_generation_triggers.sql`

Database trigger that:
- Fires when `user_preferences.plan_tier` changes to 'paid' or 'premium'
- Only triggers when `is_on_trial = false` (actual paid, not trial)
- Queues generation for all babies owned by the upgraded user
- Inserts audit log entries with `trigger_source = 'upgrade'`
- View `v_pending_advice_generation` shows queued babies

**Trigger Function**: `trigger_advice_generation_on_upgrade()`
- Runs on UPDATE of `user_preferences` table
- Security definer (runs with elevated privileges)
- Logs upgrade event for each baby

### 4. Enhanced Main Function with Telemetry ✅
**File**: `supabase/functions/generate_weekly_advice/index.ts`

Updated to log audit entries for:
- ✅ **Cached responses** - When valid plan exists (status: 'skipped')
- ✅ **Gemini API errors** - Network/API failures (status: 'error')
- ✅ **JSON parsing errors** - Invalid response format (status: 'error')
- ✅ **Database errors** - Upsert failures (status: 'error')
- ✅ **Successful generation** - New plan created (status: 'success')

All logs include:
- Execution time in milliseconds
- Model version used
- Error messages (when applicable)
- Metadata (e.g., response preview for debugging)

### 5. Comprehensive Documentation ✅
**File**: `WEEKLY_ADVICE_DEPLOYMENT.md`

- Architecture overview
- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- Environment secrets setup
- Three scheduling options (Supabase, pg_cron, GitHub Actions)

## How It Works

### Flow 1: Scheduled Weekly Generation
```
Monday 2 AM UTC
    ↓
pg_cron / Supabase Scheduler triggers
    ↓
generate_weekly_advice_batch function
    ↓
Query: SELECT babies WHERE user is paid AND not on trial
    ↓
For each baby:
    - Call generate_weekly_advice
    - Log outcome to audit table
    ↓
Return summary (success/error/skipped counts)
```

### Flow 2: User Upgrades to Paid
```
User upgrades plan_tier to 'paid'
    ↓
Database trigger fires
    ↓
trigger_advice_generation_on_upgrade()
    ↓
For each baby owned by user:
    - Insert audit log (status: 'skipped', trigger_source: 'upgrade')
    ↓
Next scheduled batch run picks up pending generations
    OR
Optional: Immediate HTTP call via pg_net
```

### Flow 3: Manual/API Generation
```
User opens Advice page
    ↓
Flutter calls generateWeeklyAdvicePlan()
    ↓
Edge Function: generate_weekly_advice
    ↓
Check cache (valid_to >= today)
    ↓
If cached: Log 'skipped' and return
If expired/missing: Generate new plan
    ↓
Call Gemini 2.5 Pro with context
    ↓
Parse JSON response
    ↓
Upsert to baby_weekly_advice
    ↓
Log 'success' to audit table
    ↓
Return plan to app
```

## Database Schema

### baby_weekly_advice
```sql
baby_id uuid PRIMARY KEY
user_id uuid NOT NULL
plan jsonb NOT NULL
model_version text
generated_at timestamptz
valid_from date
valid_to date
prompt text
response_raw jsonb
```

### advice_generation_audit
```sql
id uuid PRIMARY KEY
baby_id uuid NOT NULL
user_id uuid NOT NULL
trigger_source text CHECK (scheduled|manual|upgrade|api)
status text CHECK (success|error|skipped)
model_version text
error_message text
execution_time_ms integer
generated_at timestamptz
metadata jsonb
```

## Monitoring Queries

### Recent Activity
```sql
SELECT baby_id, trigger_source, status, execution_time_ms, generated_at
FROM advice_generation_audit
ORDER BY generated_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Success Rate
```sql
SELECT 
  trigger_source,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'success') as success,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'error') as errors,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'skipped') as skipped,
  ROUND(AVG(execution_time_ms)) as avg_ms
FROM advice_generation_audit
WHERE generated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY trigger_source;
```

### Error Analysis
```sql
SELECT error_message, COUNT(*), MAX(generated_at) as last_seen
FROM advice_generation_audit
WHERE status = 'error'
GROUP BY error_message
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

## Security

### RLS Policies
- ✅ Users can only view their own audit logs
- ✅ Service role can insert audit logs (for batch jobs)
- ✅ Weekly advice table respects user ownership
- ✅ Gemini API key never exposed to client

### Authentication
- ✅ User JWT validated for API calls
- ✅ Service role key only used server-side
- ✅ Batch function requires service role authorization

## Cost Estimates

### Gemini API (per baby per week)
- Input tokens: ~2000 (context + prompt)
- Output tokens: ~1500 (weekly plan JSON)
- Cost: ~$0.01-0.02 per generation
- Caching: 7-day validity reduces redundant calls

### Supabase
- Edge Function invocations: Free tier covers most usage
- Database storage: Minimal (1 row per baby + audit logs)
- Bandwidth: Negligible

### Example: 1000 Paid Babies
- Weekly Gemini cost: $10-20
- Monthly: $40-80
- Cached responses reduce actual cost by ~70%

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Real-time Generation on Upgrade**
   - Add `pg_net` extension
   - Update trigger to call Edge Function immediately
   - No waiting for scheduled run

2. **User-Facing Audit Dashboard**
   - Add Flutter screen to show generation history
   - Display success/error status
   - Show execution times

3. **Advanced Scheduling**
   - Different schedules for different user tiers
   - Time zone-aware scheduling
   - Retry logic for failed generations

4. **A/B Testing**
   - Log prompt variations in metadata
   - Track user engagement with different plan styles
   - Optimize prompt based on feedback

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Prevent abuse of manual refresh
   - Throttle batch generation if needed
   - Queue management for high load
