# Milestone Moments - Supabase Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated Supabase database storage for Milestone Moments feature, replacing mock data with persistent storage.

## Database Schema

### Migration: `0011_add_milestone_moments.sql`
Created new table `milestone_moments` with the following structure:

**Columns:**
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `baby_id` (UUID, Foreign Key → babies.id)
- `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key → auth.users.id)
- `title` (TEXT) - Milestone title
- `description` (TEXT) - Story/description
- `captured_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - When the moment was captured
- `shareability` (INTEGER) - Shareability score
- `priority` (INTEGER) - Priority level
- `location` (TEXT) - Location where moment occurred
- `share_context` (TEXT) - Additional context for sharing
- `photo_url` (TEXT) - URL to photo in Supabase Storage
- `stickers` (JSONB) - Array of hashtags/stickers
- `highlights` (JSONB) - Array of milestone highlights (for anniversaries)
- `delights` (JSONB) - Array of delight objects with title/description (for anniversaries)
- `is_anniversary` (BOOLEAN) - Whether this is an anniversary moment
- `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Record creation timestamp
- `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Last update timestamp

**Features:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Automatic `updated_at` trigger
- Indexes on `baby_id` and `captured_at` for performance
- Cascade delete when baby is deleted

## Code Changes

### 1. SupabaseService (`lib/services/supabase_service.dart`)
Added methods:
- `uploadMilestonePhoto()` - Uploads photo to Supabase Storage bucket 'baby-photos'
- `saveMilestoneMoment()` - Inserts new milestone moment record
- `getMilestoneMoments()` - Fetches all moments for a baby (ordered by captured_at DESC)
- `deleteMilestoneMoment()` - Deletes a moment by ID

### 2. BabyProvider (`lib/providers/baby_provider.dart`)
Added wrapper methods:
- `uploadMilestonePhoto()` - Handles photo upload with error handling
- `saveMilestoneMoment()` - Saves moment with all fields
- `getMilestoneMoments()` - Retrieves moments for a baby
- `deleteMilestoneMoment()` - Deletes a moment

### 3. Progress Screen (`lib/screens/progress_screen.dart`)
Updated methods:
- `initState()` - Now loads moments from database on initialization
- `_loadMomentsFromDatabase()` - Fetches and converts database records to `_MilestoneMoment` objects
- `_saveMoment()` - Now async, uploads photo and saves to Supabase
- `_deleteMoment()` - Deletes moment from database and reloads list
- `_promptDeleteMoment()` - Updated to call `_deleteMoment()`

## Data Flow

### Saving a Moment:
1. User completes wizard and clicks "Save milestone moment"
2. Photo (if exists) is uploaded to Supabase Storage → returns public URL
3. Delights data is formatted from `List<Map<String, String>>` to JSON
4. All data is inserted into `milestone_moments` table
5. Moments list is reloaded from database
6. UI updates with new moment

### Loading Moments:
1. On screen init or baby change, `_loadMomentsFromDatabase()` is called
2. Fetches all moments for current baby from database
3. Converts database records to `_MilestoneMoment` objects
4. Delights JSON is parsed back to formatted strings
5. Photo URL is stored in `photoAssetPath` field
6. UI displays moments list

### Deleting a Moment:
1. User confirms deletion in dialog
2. `deleteMilestoneMoment()` removes record from database
3. Moments list is reloaded from database
4. UI updates to remove deleted moment

## Storage Structure

Photos are stored in Supabase Storage:
```
baby-photos/
  └── milestone_photos/
      └── {baby_id}/
          └── milestone_{baby_id}_{timestamp}.jpg
```

## Delights Data Structure

Delights are stored as JSONB array:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Favourite food",
    "description": "Pizza"
  },
  {
    "title": "Best friend",
    "description": "Teddy bear"
  }
]
```

## Next Steps

To deploy:
1. Run migration: `supabase migration up`
2. Ensure 'baby-photos' storage bucket exists in Supabase
3. Configure bucket permissions for authenticated users
4. Test photo upload and moment creation

## Notes

- Photos are stored separately in Supabase Storage for better performance
- All moments are tied to both baby_id and user_id for proper access control
- RLS policies ensure users can only access their own moments
- Delights feature is only available for anniversary moments
- The system gracefully handles missing photos (uses photoAssetPath for URLs)
