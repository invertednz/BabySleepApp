## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (>=2.17.0)
- Firebase project with Firestore and Authentication enabled
- FlutterFire CLI installed

### Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies**
```bash
cd babymaths_app
flutter pub get
```

2. **Configure Firebase**
```bash
# Install FlutterFire CLI
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

# Configure Firebase for this app
flutterfire configure --project=baby-maths --out=lib/firebase_options.dart
```

3. **Add Firebase configuration files**
   - Android: Place `google-services.json` in `android/app/`
   - iOS: Place `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `ios/Runner/`

4. **Deploy Firestore rules and indexes**
```bash
cd ..  # Navigate to babymaths folder
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

5. **Import sample milestones**
   - Use Firebase Console or a script to import maths milestone seed data

6. **Run the app**
```bash
flutter run
```
