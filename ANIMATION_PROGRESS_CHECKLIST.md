## üß™ Testing Checklist

After updating each screen, verify:

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Animations play smoothly (60fps)
- [ ] Stagger delay is 100ms between cards
- [ ] Page transitions are 300ms cross-fade
- [ ] No animation queue buildup on rapid navigation
- [ ] Content is readable during animation

### Accessibility Testing
- [ ] Test with "Reduce Motion" enabled (iOS)
- [ ] Test with "Remove Animations" enabled (Android)
- [ ] Verify animations are disabled/instant
- [ ] Verify content is still fully accessible
- [ ] Test with screen reader

### Performance Testing
- [ ] No dropped frames in DevTools
- [ ] Animation controllers are disposed
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Smooth on low-end devices
- [ ] Battery impact is minimal

## üìù Notes

### Tips for Efficient Implementation
1. **Batch similar screens** - Update all grid-based screens together
2. **Use copy-paste** - Goals screen is a perfect template
3. **Test as you go** - Don't wait until the end
4. **Pair program** - Faster with two people
5. **Take breaks** - Avoid repetitive strain

### Common Issues
- **Forgot to dispose controller** ‚Üí Memory leak
- **Animation too slow** ‚Üí Check duration calculation
- **Cards don't stagger** ‚Üí Verify index is passed correctly
- **Navigation not smooth** ‚Üí Ensure using `pushWithFade()`
- **Reduced motion not working** ‚Üí Check MediaQuery usage
