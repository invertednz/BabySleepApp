## Key Features

### 1. Baby Progress Preview Screen (NEW)
**File:** `onboarding_baby_progress_screen.dart`

**Features:**
- **Carousel Support**: Swipe through multiple babies
- **Visual Progress Display**: Same avatar + progress pins as main app
- **Personalized Insights**: AI-generated messaging based on actual scores
  - "What's Going Well" - Celebrates strengths
  - "Growth Opportunity" - Identifies improvement areas
- **Marketing Psychology**: 
  - Shows current state to create awareness
  - Highlights gaps to create urgency
  - Uses baby's name for personalization

**Insight Generation Logic:**
```dart
// Analyzes 5 development domains:
- Cognitive (Brain)
- Social
- Communication (Speech)
- Motor (Gross Motor)
- Fine Motor

// Generates personalized messages:
- If score >= 75%: "Excelling" messaging
- If score >= 50%: "On track" messaging
- If score < 50%: "Building skills" messaging
```

**Example Messages:**
- Strength: "Isabelle is excelling in brain developmentâ€”she's in the top 28% of babies her age!"
- Opportunity: "Let's focus on boosting speech and language. With the right activities, Isabelle can catch up quickly."

### 2. Payment Screen Redesign (NEW)
